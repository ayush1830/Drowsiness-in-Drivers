The folder driver-safety contains:
1. main.py - our code with functions for face detection, checks drowsiness of eyes,
yawning and head pose estimation
2. alarm1.wav - the alarm tone we have used throughout our code
3. classes.txt - contains information about the 80 classes of COCO objects that YOLO
is capable of detecting, which we used in mobile phone detection
4. facial_landmarks_68markup.jpg - image which shows the 68 landmarks features
as defined in dlib
5. fun.py - contains the code for the YOLO detection part which basically includes
the Darknet 53 CNN model
6. lowlight_enhancement.ipynb - contains the Colab notebook used for image
enhancement
7. yolov3-320.cfg, yovlov3-320.weights - supporting files for YOLO
8. shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat - supporting file for using face detector
from dlib

1. Install PyCharm or VS code
(https://www.toolsqa.com/blogs/install-visual-studio-code/,
https://www.guru99.com/how-to-install-python.html)
2. Install opencv by typing the following command in the terminal:
pip install opencv-python
3. Install numpy
pip install numpy
4. Install dlib library with the help of the following steps:
The following link can be directly referred to in case of vs code:
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-
10-57348ba1117f
Then install cmake using the following terminal command:
pip install cmake
And then dlib using the following command
pip install dlib
5. Download the shape face predictor of dlib from
https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models and extract the dat file
6. Install pygame - this is for playing the alarm.This can be done with the help of the
following command in the terminal:
pip install pygame
7. Install tensorflow with the help of the following command:
pip install tensorflowUse the following command in case errors come up:
pip install tensorflow == 2.2
8. In our drive, there is a file named fun.py. Please download that directly, it
contains the CNN model that will work for mobile phone detection.
9. Install wget, math and scipy libraries - with
pip install wget
pip install math
pip install scipy
10. Open this link to download the yolo3.weights file -
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
This is also available in the given drive link
11. Run main.py from the drive link
While using the cv2.VideoCapture(), use 0 argument to use the systemâ€™s own webcam. In
case you want to use an external camera, use argument 1. Install Droidcam client in
order to use the secondary camera
